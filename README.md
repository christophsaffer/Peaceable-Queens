### Peaceable Armies Of N Queens ###

Problem description: 

We have N black queens and N white queens. The queens can move the same way as in normal chess (horizontal, vertical, diagonal). How many queens of both colors can we place on the chess board (maximize N) for a fixed dimension D (size of the chess board) such that no queen can reach a queen of the other color.
